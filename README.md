#Project 1: Air Quality Data Analysis for Nebraska


### Project Overview
#### This project analyzes air quality data collected from AirPurple sensors across Nebraska. The goal is to identify air pollution patterns related to volatile organic compounds (VOC), 
PM2.5, and PM10, and to evaluate how environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, altitude, and location may impact air quality. The analysis was completed for the UNMC Water, Climate and Health Working Group.

### Data
#### The raw air quality data used in this project were provided as a CSV file. The dataset includes daily measurements of VOC, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, humidity, sensor altitude, and sensor location.
