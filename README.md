#Project 1: Air Quality Data Analysis for Nebraska


### Project Overview
#### This project analyzes air quality data collected from AirPurple sensors across Nebraska. The goal is to identify air pollution patterns related to volatile organic compounds (VOC), 
PM2.5, and PM10, and to evaluate how environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, altitude, and location may impact air quality. The analysis was completed for the UNMC Water, Climate and Health Working Group.

### Data
#### The raw air quality data used in this project were provided as a CSV file. The dataset includes daily measurements of VOC, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, humidity, sensor altitude, and sensor location.
#### Raw data: AirQuality_Daily_StudentVersion.csv

### Method
#### All analysis was performed using Python and the pandas library in a Jupyter Notebook. The data were #### grouped by sensor name to calculate summary statistics, identify maximum pollution events, evaluate AQI risk days, and examine #### relationships between air quality and environmental conditions.

### Files in This Repository
#### Project1_Python_codes.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing all Python code used for the analysis

### How to Run the Code
#### Download the repository files.
#### Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
#### Make sure the CSV data file is in the same folder as the notebook.
#### Run all cells in order to reproduce the analysis and results.
